I am a rising junior-year undergraduate student at ShanghaiTech University majoring in computer science and technology.  My primary fields of interest span computer vision, computational photography, and graphics, with a particular focus on the domains of neural modeling and rendering, and the digital portrayal of humans and animals.

At present, my research is centered around unearthing an innovative method of 3D modeling, a method that successfully combines the advantages of traditional rendering pipelines with the cutting-edge progress in neural radiance fields. A significant application of this technology is in animal fur modeling, a subfield to which I am fervently committed.

My ambition is to seamlessly blend the strengths of traditional methods with the potential of advanced neural radiance fields, with the objective of advancing new frontiers in 3D modeling. As I navigate through this riveting field, my goal is to make substantial contributions to the understanding and evolution of computer vision, digital graphics, and computational photography.
