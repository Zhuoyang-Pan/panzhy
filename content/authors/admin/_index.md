I am a rising junior-year undergraduate student at ShanghaiTech University majoring in computer science and technology.  My primary fields of interest span computer vision, computational photography, and graphics, with a particular focus on the domains of neural modeling and rendering, and the digital portrayal of humans and animals.

At present, my research is centered around unearthing an innovative method of 3D modeling, a method that successfully combines the advantages of traditional rendering pipelines with the cutting-edge progress in neural radiance fields. A significant application of this technology is in animal fur modeling, a subfield to which I am fervently committed.

My ambition is to seamlessly blend the strengths of traditional methods with the potential of advanced neural radiance fields, with the objective of advancing new frontiers in 3D modeling. As I navigate through this riveting field, my goal is to make substantial contributions to the understanding and evolution of computer vision, digital graphics, and computational photography.

Since 2022, I've been fortunate to be a part of the VRVC Lab at ShanghaiTech University, mentored by Prof. Jingyi Yu and Prof. Lan Xu. Through this website, I aim to chronicle my journey, sharing not only my research findings but also my passion for these multifaceted areas of computer science. Let's delve into the fascinating world of digital representation together and push the boundaries of what's currently achievable in the realm of computer vision and graphics.
